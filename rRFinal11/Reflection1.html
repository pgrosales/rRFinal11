                  I can say that I was satisfied on my first week on USERDES class because from the beginning I am really interested in this subject, I love designing things although before this class, I don’t have someone to guide me in designing, that’s why I appreciate our professor because she keeps our class interactive while at the same time we also learn new things. 

                   <span id="text4">
                    I think I really was able to provide a creative idea on our elevator activity, because I never thought I would be designing those kinds of things which made me more interested in designing. Before this class, my understanding of ‘designing’ is limited to how it will be attracting to look at, it never crossed my mind that designing include the ‘how will it work’ part. The ambience on this class is very soothing. Having a professor who I can say that we can vibe with while providing us with knowledge is very fun to have. I am looking forward to having a lots of fun while learning.

                 The class atmosphere this week is even lighter compared to last week, I’ve learned more things about this subject. Thinking of an application might sound easy but considering every aspect such as problems, possible solution, how will it be implemented, designs, are exhausting. 
          We also had a chance to think thoroughly, considering everything that can affect our desired project.</p>

There’s also a lot of materials that we can learn from accessible anywhere, so the learning is not limited to our classroom. I wish the atmosphere will stay till the end of the term.

                  This week’s task to create a Web application was kind of hard for me since the last time I programmed using HTML was years ago so I had a hard time doing a website that suits my preferences,
			           	so I had to check some tutorials on the internet to do a certain thing on my web app. 
                  <div>
            <br>
           <span id="text2"> The hardest obstacle that I’ve encountered is adjusting the images 
			             so that It wont look like as if it is shouting, although I find it hard 
			to adjust, I’ve just scratched that idea and started to make a new design on 
			my L2 which is to use Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript. I am familiar with the terms 
			but it is still hard for me to find what would I really like because ideas just keep 
			coming so I had to change a certain thing again and again so this task is time consuming 
			for me although I am having fun while doing this. Uploading to GitHub and making my app run i
			in Heroku did go smoothly, but the results isn’t that good. The valuable thing I’ve learned while doing this task is it is okay to keep changing ideas because exploration of concepts is good, it might be time consuming but at the same time I am learning, and I can use the ideas that I didn’t use as a future reference. Also, this task made me aware that I need to study more about HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript since I had to 
			rely on the internet to do my task. </span>

                  First thing is that this practice is basically an experience when dealing with an incorrect way of doing a website which really 
                helped me be aware of the things I should avoid when doing a website. </p>
					
					<div>
					  <br>
					 <span id="text">I felt irritated the whole time because of the misleading designs which kind of gave me a hard time while doing this but at the same time I’ve been more aware of the things I should and should not do in designing. Also this activity really informed me that reading is fundamental, anyone can finish this when they know how to read and just use their common sense although it took me 9 minutes at my trial but at my second trial I’ve finished the practice in less than 3 minutes. The most annoying part is the verification part because it is tiring to click all the same pictures just for verification also the terms and condition part is irritating because of the slow scrolling speed but I used a trick in speeding it but if I wasn’t able to know that trick, it might make me more irritated than I really am while doing that UI practice.
                  Basically this activity is just to make us learn about doing the correct way in designing,  I am hoping for more activity like this because it is challenging and informative.

									 <p class="tm-p-mb">	This year’s SOCIT Fest is good for me because it was able to expose me in different platforms that can be used in my subjects. </p>  

       
      
       

				Azure works like Heroku although it seems more complicated to use compared to Heroku so I think I’m still going to use Heroku. Although the speaker might be the reason of the event’s success and I might not be able to contribute something, but at least I was able to learn something through this seminar which is the speaker’s main objective in doing the seminar. I think that this event can be improved into an interactive type of seminar instead of the speaker just talking, I think that there should be a part in which we are able access a premade site which is created through that platform. 
				My expectations for next year’s SOCIT Fest is just for it to be more an interactive type of event.

The challenges I’ve encountered was being undecisive on my work, especially on the Lab 1 and Lab 2 part, because I kept changing my design due to new ideas, but I think it was a good thing because that’s the activity’s point was about. My expectations for the finals are the same for all the subjects, I think it will be hard, and time consuming. The class for me is already good and there’s nothing left to improve.
