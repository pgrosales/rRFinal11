						                  		<p> I’m Patrick Rosales and I’m 19 years old and, I live at Merville, Pasay City. 
                  During the first year of my Senior High, I’m not used in going somewhere alone, 
                  <span id="text5"> so I am nervous because it will be my first time travelling/commuting alone going to Asia Pacific College, so I think I can say that the nervousness I felt is an indicator that I kind of traveled by myself to place I can consider new for me. After staying in APC during my senior high school days, My friends and I, had a summer outing by ourselves, it was my first time going on a beach without my family, I was scared because we commuted by just following direction we found on the internet so I was nervous the whole time because I think that we might get lost, but fortunately, we didn’t, so for me I think that I had an unexpected adventure with my friends because I was able to do the things that I’m not used to. 

                   I was able to relax and have fun with my friends. I spent my summer at home, playing games, eating, and sleeping, so I think that is enough for me because I prefer to maximize the vacation by relaxing at home, some would say that my summer is boring, but I am satisfied with what I’ve done the whole summer.   Since I usually have a good time with my friends, and we’ve been together for years, I am usually happy with them. I can say that I’m an optimist person, so sad/depressing things rarely affects me. 

                  I expect this class to be fun because this includes designing which is one of my interests, I also expect this class to be also hard because this subject is I think is a fundamental part of my course as BSIT-MI since designing would be a vital part of making a program.</span></p>
